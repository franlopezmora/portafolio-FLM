description: "How we built Cruma, the schedule planner made by and for students."
---

In July, with **Nicolás Garay**, we set out to solve a problem that all students know: **building schedules without going crazy**.  
The idea of Cruma sounded simple: choose subjects, see sections, avoid conflicts... but behind it there were a lot of small decisions that, together, make the experience **fluid** and not a fight against the computer.

More than telling you *what* we did, in this essay I tell you **how we built it**: what we decided, how we divided it to show something quickly, and above all, what details we put love into.

## The grid

We worked with 5-minute steps and common origin at 08:00. This way, any schedule can be translated to pixels without surprises.

**Always** we order by day and start time, so nothing "jumps" in the view. And we map the days by hand: Monday = 1, Tuesday = 2... no weird magic.

## Preview vs. fixed

When you're testing sections, what you see as **preview** always stays above what you've already chosen.  
Why? Because if you're evaluating something, it's what matters most to you at that moment. A simple `z-index` well thought out makes all the difference.

## Conflicts between previews

If two previews conflict on the same day and time slot, **they don't overlap**: the column splits in half and each one occupies its side.  
If there are three or more, it keeps subdividing and that's it.

In those tight cases, we only show the basics: code, section and time. Less noise = more clarity.

## The flow

Cruma doesn't make you think about the app, it facilitates building your schedule:

1. Without a chosen career, we show nothing.  
2. You choose semester → we bring subjects from that period and annual ones.  
3. Only then we enable search and filters.  
4. If you change career or semester, we reset everything.

## Subject search

Year filter on the left, search on the right.  
The listing only appears if you type something.  
You check a subject and the input clears to keep adding quickly.  
And you always have the "Selected" panel handy to remove what you want.

## From PDF to useful data

This part was the most complicated. The schedules came in PDF format:  
And the question arose, how do we translate them to raw data?

We ended up building all the tables by hand, to be able to pass them to CSV, a format easy to import to any Database.

## Beyond Systems

For now Cruma works with Systems schedules, because they were our priority.  
But the system is already ready for any career at the university: you just need to load the data in the correct format and that's it.  
All the backend and frontend logic are designed to scale without drama.

## Open repo

The code is in a public repo: [github.com/franlopezmora/cruma](https://github.com/franlopezmora/cruma).  
If you want to join, whether fixing a bug, loading schedules from another career or adding a visual improvement, go ahead.

## What's coming

* **Stable hosting** so it's online all year.  
* **Own domain** (cruma.ar would be a goal).  
* **HTTPS certificate** for security and trust.  
* **Add more careers** from the university.  
* **Automate** the schedule loading process.  
* **Optimize mobile** so using it from your phone is as comfortable as on the computer.

## Closing

Cruma was born to take a weight off our shoulders, and without meaning to, it ended up ready to help anyone who builds their course schedule.  
Today it serves Systems, tomorrow it can serve the entire university.

The code is open, the system is prepared and the only thing missing is giving it the infrastructure it deserves so it lives all year.

At its core, Cruma is that: **an invitation to use it, improve it and make building your week something simple and even fun**, not a headache with PDFs and spreadsheets.
